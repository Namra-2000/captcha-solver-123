# CAPTCHA Solver Application This is a simple, single-file web application designed to demonstrate a basic CAPTCHA solving interface. It uses HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side logic. The CAPTCHA image shows the text "ADCR3". ## Features - **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a good user experience across various device sizes. - **Dynamic Image Loading:** The CAPTCHA image can be loaded from a URL specified in the query parameters (`?url=...`) or defaults to `sample.png`. - **Client-side Validation:** Compares user input against a predefined CAPTCHA solution. - **Visual Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback to the user on whether the CAPTCHA was solved correctly. ## Usage To use this application: 1.  Save the `index.html` file and `sample.png` (provided separately) in the same directory. 2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser. The application will default to displaying `sample.png`. 3.  To test with a different image, append a `url` query parameter to the `index.html` URL. For example: `file:///path/to/index.html?url=https://example.com/some-captcha-image.png` (Note: Browser security policies might restrict direct file URL access to external images. For best results, serve this via a local web server if using external URLs). 4.  Type "ADCR3" into the input field and click "Solve CAPTCHA" to see the correct solution message. ## Technologies Used - **HTML5:** For the page structure. - **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design. - **JavaScript:** For interactive functionality and CAPTCHA validation. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License.
